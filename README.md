# MVP Blackjack
Simple "minimum viable product" Blackjack game to teach myself the Jetpack Compose framework.

## Layout
The source code and [README](src/README.md) explaining the code in detail are in [src](src/).

## Project Goals

* Use Kotlin and the latest Android Jetpack APIs.
* Use a custom font and color scheme.
* Use Hilt to write unit tests and functional tests.
* Support accessibility (e.g. large fonts, screen readers).

* Preserves settings and current game state across app restarts.
* No obvious resource leaks or bugs.
